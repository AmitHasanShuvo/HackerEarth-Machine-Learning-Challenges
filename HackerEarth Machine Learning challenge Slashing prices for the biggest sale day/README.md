## Competition: HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge: Slashing prices for the biggest sale day

### Task: Predict the lowest price

A leading global leader of e-commerce has over 150 million paid subscription users. One of the many perks of the subscription is the privilege of buying products at lower prices. For an upcoming sale, the organization has decided to promote local artisans and their products, to help them through these tough times. However, slashed prices may impact local artists.

To not let discounts affect local artists, the company has decided to determine the lowest price at which a particular good can be sold. Your task is to build a predictive model using Machine Learning that helps them set up a lowest-pricing model for these products.

You have to predict the Low_Cap_Price column.

The dataset folder consists of the following files:

- Train.csv: Contains training data [9798 x 9] that must be used to build the model
- Test.csv: Contains test data [5763 x 8] to be predicted on
- sample_submission.csv: Contains sample submission format with dummy values filled for test data
